:numbered:

== Introduction and Goals
Describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software architects and development team must consider. These include

* underlying business goals, essential features and functional requirements for the system
* quality goals for the architecture
* relevant stakeholders and their expectations

See: link:architecture/01_introduction_and_goals.adoc[Introduction and Goals]

== Architecture Constraints

Any requirement that constrains software architects in their freedom of design and implementation decisions or decision about the development process. These constraints sometimes go beyond individual systems and are valid for whole organizations and companies.

See: link:architecture/02_architecture_constraints.adoc[Architecture Constraints]

== System Scope and Context

System scope and context - as the name suggests - delimits your system (i.e. your scope) from all its communication partners
(neighboring systems and users, i.e. the context of your system). It thereby specifies the external interfaces.

=> TBD

// See: link:architecture/03_system_scope_and_context.adoc[System Scope and Context]

== Solution Strategy

A short summary and explanation of the fundamental decisions and solution strategies, that shape the system's architecture. These include

* technology decisions
* decisions about the top-level decomposition of the system, e.g. usage of an architectural pattern or design pattern
* decisions on how to achieve key quality goals
* relevant organizational decisions, e.g. selecting a development process or delegating certain tasks to third parties.

=> TBD

// See: link:architecture/04_solution_strategy.adoc[Solution Strategy]

== Building Block View

The building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes,
interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers, functions, macros, operations,
datas structures, ...) as well as their dependencies (relationships, associations, ...)

=> TBD

// See: link:architecture/05_building_block_view.adoc[Building Block View]

== Runtime View

The runtime view describes concrete behavior and interactions of the systemâ€™s building blocks in form of scenarios from the following areas:

* important use cases or features: how do building blocks execute them?
* interactions at critical external interfaces
* operation and administration: launch, start-up, stop
* error and exception scenarios

=> TBD

// See: link:architecture/06_runtime_view.adoc[Runtime View]

== Deployment View

* the technical infrastructure used to execute your system, with infrastructure elements like  environments, computers, processors, channels and net topologies as well as other infrastructure elements 

* the mapping of (software) building blocks to that infrastructure elements.

=> TBD 

// See: link:architecture/07_deployment_view.adoc[Deployment View]

== Concepts
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are
relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* domain models
* architecture patterns or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of overall decisions
* implementation rules

=> TBD

// See: link:architecture/08_concepts.adoc[Concepts]

== Design Decisions

Important, expensive, large scale or risky architecture decisions including rationals.
With "decisions" we mean selecting one alternative based on given criteria.

=> TBD

// See: link:architecture/09_design_decisions.adoc[Design Decisions]

== Quality Scenarios

This section contains all quality requirements as quality tree with scenarios. The most important ones have already been described in "Quality Goals"

=> TBD

// See: link:architecture/10_quality_scenarios.adoc[Quality Scenarios]

== Technical Risks

A list of identified technical risks or technical debts, ordered by priority

=> TBD

// See: link:architecture/11_technical_risks.adoc[Technical Risks]


== Glossary

The most important domain and technical terms that  stakeholders use when discussing the system.

=> TBD

// See: link:architecture/12_glossary.adoc[Glossary]

This architecture documentation uses / is based on the ARC42 Template in a modified form for GitHub
