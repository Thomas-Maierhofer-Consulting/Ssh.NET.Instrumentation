== Introduction and Goals
SSH Instrumentation is a key functionality in system and integration testing on hardware (IoT, Industry 4.0). The .NET Framework has a mature SSH.NET library which supports shells and commands. The commands provide already a instrumentation interface for SSH but with one major drawback: The command is implemented as a SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_REQUEST "exec" (RFC 4254) which is not shell bound. This has some unwanted implications:

* The command is not terminated on a connection loss
* A hanging command is not killed on the server side on Dispose() on the client side

The purpose of this library is to provide a shell bound instrumentation interface for SSH.NET which allows to execute commands without having detached/orphaned processes after cleanup or connection loss.

=== Requirements Overview

[options="header",cols="1,2,2"]

|ID|Requirement|Description
| R-1 | Create Instrumentation Shell | Create a ShellInstrumentation object on a SshClient object

| R-3 | Wait for Execution Result | Wait for the result (exit code) of executed commands
| R-4 | Support IDisposable | Dispose ShellInstrumentation objects with the IDisposable interface
| R-5 | Get Command Output | Subscribe to output Event to get interactive command output
